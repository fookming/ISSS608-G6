# Overview

Importance of incorporating geospatial analysis in visual analysis for time series weather data

## The Data

-   Scraped weather data from

-   Weather Station records

-   Singapore Master Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary

# Install R packages

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, DT ,tmap, sf, sfdep, corrplot)
```

# Data Wrangling

## Data Import and Preparation

### Daily Weather Records

First we read in the daily weather records scraped from weather.gov.sg into tibble dataframe `climate_raw` using `read_csv()` .

```{r}
climate_raw = read_csv("WebScraping/data/climate_historical_daily_records/Climate_Data_2015_2024.csv")
```

### Weather Station Records

```{r}
station = read_csv("WebScraping/data/Station_Records.csv") |>
  filter(Station_Type != "Closed Station")
```

Check duplicate

```{r}
duplicate <- station %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(n()>1) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
duplicate
```

### Master Plan Subzone Boundary

```{r}
mpsz = st_read(dsn = "Geospatial/data", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

## Data Wrangling

Filter daily weather data for active stations only

```{r}
climate = inner_join(station,climate_raw, by = "Station")
```

Check duplicate

```{r}
duplicate <- climate %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(n()>1) %>% 
  ungroup()
  
duplicate
```

The output shows there is no duplicate in `climate` dataframe.

Next we select relevant columns for further geospatial analysis

```{r}
climate = climate |>
  select(c(Station, Station_Type, Year, Month, Day, `Daily Rainfall Total (mm)`, `Mean Temperature (Celsius)`, `Mean Wind Speed (km/h)`))
```

Since there are stations that only measure rainfall, we split into two dataframes:

-   `climate_rain`: include all stations and only measurement on `Daily Rainfall Total (mm)`

-   `climate_temperature_wind`: include only full AWS stations and only measurements on `Mean Temperature (Celsius)` and `Mean Wind Speed (km/h)`.

```{r}
climate_rain = climate |>
  select(c(Station, Station_Type, Year, Month, Day, `Daily Rainfall Total (mm)`))
summary(climate_rain)
```

```{r}
climate_temperature_wind = climate |>
  select(c(Station, Station_Type, Year, Month, Day, `Mean Temperature (Celsius)`, `Mean Wind Speed (km/h)`)) |>
  filter(Station_Type == "Full AWS Station")

summary(climate_temperature_wind)
```

There are many null values in all three measurements, we continue to explore from which stations and year, month those null records come from.

```{r}
# Count missing values for each Station, Year, and Month
missing_rain_counts <- climate_rain %>%
  group_by(Station, Year, Month) %>%
  summarise(
    `Missing Daily Rainfall Total` = sum(is.na(`Daily Rainfall Total (mm)`))
  ) %>%
  # Exclude rows where all missing counts are zero
  filter(`Missing Daily Rainfall Total` > 0)

# # Display using datatable
# datatable(missing_rain_counts, options = list(pageLength = 10), rownames = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Count missing values for each Station, Year, and Month
missing_rain_counts <- climate_temperature_wind %>%
  group_by(Station, Year, Month) %>%
  summarise(
    `Missing Mean Temperature` = sum(is.na(`Mean Temperature (Celsius)`)),
    `Missing Mean Wind Speed` = sum(is.na(`Mean Wind Speed (km/h)`))
  ) %>%
  # Exclude rows where all missing counts are zero
  filter(`Missing Mean Temperature` > 0 | 
         `Missing Mean Wind Speed` > 0)

# # Display using datatable
# datatable(missing_rain_counts, options = list(pageLength = 10), rownames = FALSE)
```
