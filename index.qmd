# Motivation

Singapore’s tropical climate creates frequent and intense weather variations, which significantly impact sectors like urban planning, insurance, agriculture, and infrastructure. However, current weather platforms fall short in supporting data-driven decision-making due to:

-   **Basic Functionality**: Existing dashboards offer only real-time observations and short-term forecasts.

-   **No Advanced Analytics**: Lack of tools like trend forecasting, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.

-   **Limited Historical Insights**: Inability to analyze long-term climate trends or generate custom comparisons.

These factors signify a need for a comprehensive platform offering statistical insights, spatial visualizations, and predictive modeling of Singapore weather measurements.

# Objectives

Our project tackles this challenge by offering a platform with rich analytics, interactive visualizations, and predictive tools tailored to Singapore’s context. The project focuses on three main objectives:

1.  **Build a Comprehensive Weather Analytics Platform:** Integrate historical weather data from the Meteorological Service Singapore; covering temperature, rainfall, and wind, organized by station and time for easy access and analysis.

2.  **Develop Advanced Visual Analytics:** Offer interactive time series and geospatial visualizations using robust statistical techniques to uncover patterns, anomalies, and future conditions in Singapore’s weather.

3.  **Ensure Independent and Flexible Use Across Sectors:** Design a user-friendly platform that supports diverse stakeholders - businesses, academics, and government agencies - with decision-making and strategic planning based on their unique needs.

# Main Features

The final **WeatherWise SG** Shiny Application consists of three core modules:

1.  **Time Series Data Analysis**: Delivers interactive visualizations for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis, uncovering trends and comparisons in temperature, rainfall, and wind across different stations and time periods.

2.  **Time Series Forecasting**: Offers time series decomposition into trend, seasonality, and residuals, along with forecasting tools that allow parameter customization. Forecasts are displayed alongside historical data for clear visual comparison.

3.  **Geospatial Analysis**: Features multiple maps to visualize extreme weather events by station and interpolated weather conditions at unmeasured locations using Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) and Kriging methods.
