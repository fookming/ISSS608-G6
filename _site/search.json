    "text": "Singapore’s tropical climate, characterized by high temperatures, humidity, and intense rainfall, presents significant environmental and operational challenges across various sectors. Industries such as urban planning, real estate, insurance, agriculture, and infrastructure management require accurate and real-time weather analytics to make data-driven decisions and mitigate climate-related risks.\nHowever, existing weather dashboards offer limited insights, focusing primarily on basic real-time observations without deep analytical capabilities, trend forecasting, or business-context integration. This project aims to address these gaps by developing a comprehensive, standalone weather analytics platform tailored to Singapore’s unique climate conditions.\nAdditionally, the platform will incorporate robust statistical methods, spatial visualizations, and advanced predictive modelling tools. These analytical capabilities will empower businesses, researchers, and policymakers to independently derive actionable insights, thereby enhancing strategic climate resilience decision-making. By balancing specialized climate data provision with generalized applicability, the platform will serve diverse informational needs without being restricted to any specific industry."

We will perform two key analyses: \n\nLocal Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA): Identifies statistically significant clusters or outliers where weather conditions deviate from surrounding locations. \nEmerging Hot Spot Analysis (EHSA): Identify persistent hot spots (regions where temperature or rainfall remains high) and cold spots (regions with consistently low values), highlight locations with shifting weather patterns. \n\nSpatial Interpolation and Geographically Weighted Predictive Modeling for Weather Forecasting:\n\nInterpolate weather conditions at unmeasured locations based on nearby data points using distance weight and Kriging method \nDerive predictive models incorporate both temporal and spatial dependencies using Geographically Weighted Random Forest."
